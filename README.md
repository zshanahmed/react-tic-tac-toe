## Tic Tac Toe Game
This project was developed to understand the basic workings of React framework. Few of the key learning takeaways are as follows:
* Creating components and passing props from parent to child components
* Working of component states and how they can be updated
* Using history to keep track of states at different points in time and traversing through different version of states
